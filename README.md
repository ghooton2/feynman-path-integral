# feynman-path-integral

This is python code for a university computing project for a physics degree.
It was to investigate the Feynman path integral which uses MCMC methods for numerical integration.
For more context behind the physics, please look at the pdf of the poster that explains how MCMC methods are used to find the ground state wave function.
